- :wave: Hi, I'm @mustberuss
- :registered: I'm interested in patent data, the older the better, bulk data and APIs for patents and trademarks    
     (It's not opensource yet but I am a developer of and data steward for [datamp.org](https://datamp.org/) should you have an interest in patents of old tools.)
- :telescope: I've also gotten into R and am working on updating the patentsview API's R package for the new version of the API
- :telescope: and it shouldn't be a surprise that I've contributed to the python wrappers for the patentsview API (the API team's and another by mikeym88, both pinned below) **Of note, <ins>the API team archived their repo</ins>**. I've pushed changes for the new version of the API to my fork, theirs is coded for the retired version
