- :wave: Hi, I'm @mustberuss
- :registered: I'm interested in patent data, the older the better, bulk data and APIs for patents and trademarks
- :telescope: I've also gotten into R and am working on updating the patentsview API's R package for the new version of the API
- :telescope: and it shouldn't be a surprise that I've been playing around with the python wrappers for the patentsview API (the API team's and another by mikeym88, both pinned below) Of note, the API team archived theirs, guessing I should push my changes for the new version of the API!
